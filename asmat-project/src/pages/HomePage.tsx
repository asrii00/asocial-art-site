                Social media apps are designed to keep you addicted. This site is designed to be boring. It exists just so that you can see what your artist friends have been up to. You can post art and view art, and that's it.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                You have to request to join, and only a maximum of 50 people will be allowed in.  You get your own page where you can post pictures, but don't expect anyone to react to them. There is no "Like", "Comment", or anything like that. If someone viewed your art, you will never know. We simply scream out into the void.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                There is a guest book where you can leave comments, but it's not designed for you to comment on any specific user's art. It's just there so we can chat.

                <br/><br/>

                So - let's just post our silly little pictures and try to keep our sanity.

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Ps. The only rule is that you have to be nice to other users or you will get banned.
